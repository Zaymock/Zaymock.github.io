My experience with professor in person at A&T have been an roller coaster but i admire Professor Foreman because he was an professor that got everybody involove and teached with an actual passion for what course he was teaching. He was an professor actually for the students making time for every student no matter if u was the slacker or best student he gave equal respect to breakdown the material and help. Professor Foreman achieve alot of accolades to back up what he talked about and he was able to give real life examples and gave us information useful for real life. Professor Foreman surrounded us around important folks and had speakers for us to learn as well, til this day Professor Foreman still send me interns and workshops to learn and build.</p>
