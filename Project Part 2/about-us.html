            <h2>Open House</h2>
            <p><strong>Open House</strong> was founded on the belief that strong communities are built through collaboration, communication, and shared purpose. Our goal is to empower individuals and groups to come together, participate in local projects, and make a lasting positive impact on our neighborhoods.</p>
